## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

In the csv-api directory, you can run to run the server:

### `node server.js`

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
Upload any cvs file using the 'Upload' button .
Use the search bar to search to fine any terms in the csv file.
Exemple search using query http://localhost:3000/api/users?q=Jane Smith

It is necessary to run server.js (back-end) for the fullstack project to work. Therefore, the error messages requested in the test will not appear because the connection will be complete.
